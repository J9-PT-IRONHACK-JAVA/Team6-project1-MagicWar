### RULES  
Warriors are strong well armored characters that focus on the attribute strength.Every round a warrior will try to do a “Heavy attack”. The damage of a heavy attackis equal to their strength and every hit will decrease their stamina by 5 points. If he can’t make a heavy attack he will do a “Weak attack”. The damage of a weak attack 
is the half of the strength (truncate decimals). Every weak attack will recover his stamina by 1.
                                                          
Wizards are the masters of the arcane their main attribute is intelligence. Every round a wizard will try to cast a “Fireball”. The damage of a fireball is equal
to his intelligence and every fireball will decrease their mana by 5 points.If he can’t cast a fireball he will do a “Staff hit”. The damage of a staff hit is equals to 2.
